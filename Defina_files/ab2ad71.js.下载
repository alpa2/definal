She has seen the darkest corners of hell and did spend literally eternity in heaven. As Carl Jung said, a tree can only grow to heaven when its roots reach down to hell. This gives Dante a very broad perspective on the inner workings of reality and how to control it for her advantage. Having seen it all, she indeed sees life as a divine comedy and does not take it too seriously. Her amusement and curiosity of the unexpected are in balance, but she seeks out novelty more than anything else, sometimes against any rational justification. Rumors say, she once challenged a demi-god, but this has never been confirmed. The zombie attacks are an interesting playground for her abilities and she can\'t wait to challenge the masterminds behind the attacks.\\nShe is able to summon hellish objects from the darkest corners of the abysmal realms - sometimes against the will of the objects being summoned. When cornered she can change form, with yet unknown abilities.","weapon_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/weapon/Dante_Alighieri_weapon.png","full_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/card/Dante_Alighieri_01.png","webp_image":"/img/webp/danding_01.webp","share_url":"https://twitter.com/Defina_Official/status/1459838559192506368/photo/1"},{"token_uri":1002,"name":"Hercules","nick":"Hercules","nickZh":"赫拉克勒斯","image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/cardcrop/Hercules_01.png","attributes":{"hero_name":"Defina Hero","faction":"Prometheus\' Fire","rarity":"SS"},"description":"Hercules posses the rare gift of creating illusions in the minds of her enemies and send them into a dram-like state of stupor. This works on those with a weak mind and also on most zombies, except those who possess an increased level of intelligence and willpower. People mistake her stoic mannerism with indifference, but in reality she plays a role and only lets very few close into her inner circle and her true self. She is able to summon inconspicuous, cute, stuffed animals that reflect her twisted sense of humor and intelligence. Enemies underestimate her and her summoned spirits which mostly ends in their demise. The spirits have their own mind and are as intelligent as she is herself. Highly adapt in combat, they have destroyed armies of zombies and Hercules alone once defeated one of the the zombie generals of the 12th legion.\\nShe also possesses Voodoo abilities and can transfer harm or healing via her summons.

In this particular reincarnation, she trained martial arts and fist fighting that is enhanced by channeling soul energy into her body which enables her to penetrate any armor with her fists alone and to damage the spirit of her enemies as well. She is well aware that those who don\'t remember their past reincarnations have difficulties to understand and come to terms with the cycle of death and rebirth, therefore she has an enormous compassion towards any individual who experiences suffering.

Indeed, the mighty undefeated zombie general Damgondoth fell for her spell and genuinely believed he was chosen by Helen to be her lover for eternity. To the surprise of everyone, he came close to her and they kissed passionately. What Damgondoth realized too late was that Helen actually sucked out all energy out of him and then killed him afterwards with his own soul energy, concentrated into a destructive dark sphere that distorted space-time itself.\\nShe is smart as she is passionate about life and knows that only few that can resist her illusory spells. She once met a special man who was not only able to resist her magic but seemed actually utterly uninterested in Helen. She has never seen him again, but this intrigued her so much that she tries to find him again. Some claim, it might have been the dark lord Nathaniel himself.","weapon_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/weapon/Helen_of_Troy_weapon.png","full_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/card/Helen_of_Troy_01.png","webp_image":"/img/webp/hailun_01.webp","share_url":"https://twitter.com/Defina_Official/status/1463688904599605254/photo/1"},{"token_uri":3004,"name":"Paris","nick":"Paris","nickZh":"帕利斯","image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/cardcrop/Paris_01.png","attributes":{"hero_name":"Defina Hero","faction":"Thoth\'s Book","rarity":"SS"},"description":"He is a collector of souls and has already a respectable collection in his possession.

Over the years his collection of custom-made spells and soul attacks grew, as he considers himself an aficionado of souls.

Once he has defeated the extremely powerful zombie lord \\"Ecolos the insane\\". Paris described the taste of his soul as the most exquisite thing he ever tasted.

She discovered her early talent when she protected her family on the spot by intuitively summoning a protective guardian from the spirit realm when they were attacked by powerful class SS siege zombies. The spirit was not angry about being summoned, to the contrary, he was amused that a young girl actually was able to lure him into the material world. As a gift the spirit granted her an audience with Vamir, lord of stone. Despite the size differences between them, she was unafraid and asked Vamir if he could train her. He agreed, under the condition to act as a connection to the material realms of mortals. Being acknowledged by such powerful entities is no easy feat and speaks volumes about Homer and her abilities. Deep down she knows that both humans, spirits and even zombies are all children of god, created as equals and all deserving of existence.","weapon_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/weapon/Homer_weapon.png","full_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/card/Homer_01.png","webp_image":"/img/webp/hema_01.webp","share_url":"https://twitter.com/Defina_Official/status/1463039700017598466/photo/1"},{"token_uri":3006,"name":"Florence Nightingale","nick":"Florence","nickZh":"南丁格尔","image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/cardcrop/Florence_Nightingale_01.png","attributes":{"hero_name":"Defina Hero","faction":"Thoth\'s Book","rarity":"S"},"description":"As a kid Florence always wanted to be a nurse or medical doctor when she had the chance. In a sense she has fulfilled that wish, even if not in the way she imagined. She was kidnapped by lady Victoria, an evil zombie demon queen who gathered humans for her experiments and to drink their blood for refreshment. Being next in line, Florence was brought into her lair where Victoria began to sing a terrifying song in a non-human voice with the purpose to break the will of her victims. This was the moment that triggered Florence\'s memories from past lives and her ability to heal wounds on her own body and to inflict wounds on enemies. Her fear transformed into rage and without yet knowing how, she boiled the blood of Victoria and all her zombie servants, thus enabling her to free herself and all other prisoners of Victoria\'s lair. Today she has mastered regenerative and poisonous magic abilities and is therefore an extremely valuable member of the human resistance.","weapon_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/weapon/Florence_Nightingale_weapon.png","full_image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/card/Florence_Nightingale_01.png","webp_image":"/img/webp/nandinggeer_01.webp","share_url":"https://twitter.com/Defina_Official/status/1463356730595815426/photo/1"},{"token_uri":3007,"name":"Akechi Mitsuhide","nick":"Akechi","nickZh":"明智光秀","image":"https://defina.finance/img/char/cardcrop/Akechi_Mitsuhide_01.png","attributes":{"hero_name":"Defina Hero","faction":"Thoth\'s Book","rarity":"A"},"description":"Akechi can\'t deny a crazy side to her mind and methods, a trait that is nonetheless very much appreciated with Thoth\'s Book where she has found peers that she can share her passion with. She received her hellish scythe, the \\"Blood Soul\\" as reward for slaying the terrifying zombie king Lonrazuhn. The vampiric scythe leeches blood from her enemies and thus heals her own wounds by transferring the life and soul energy into her own body, making it a nightmare for her enemies. Like in a trance, she dances on the battlefield, merging into the moment and forgetting time. This makes it almost impossible for enemies to keep track of her location, as she moves both unpredictably and even out of time. In her opinion life is to be enjoyed in a very playful manner.

Some claim, she might actually enter into a timeless soul state and can even benefit from her future lives, but she never denied or verified this rumor.\\nShe has both a strategic mind and masterful combat abilities.
